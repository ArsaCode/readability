Hello ! This is the readability software made for the Problem Set 6 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course.

The user should input a text (a part of a book for example, or even a whole book).

The software works as follows :

1 . Get the users input
2 . Count the total number of letters in the text
3 . Count the total number of words in the text
4 . Count the total number of sentences in the text
5 . Calculates the average of total number of letters per 100 words and total number of sentences per 100 words
6 . Calculates the readability with the Coleman-Liau's index
7 . Display the U.S Grade readability for the user (outputs possible : "Before Grade 1, Grade 1 to Grade 16, Grade 16+").
